# **Reward Seasons**

Embrace the challenge and climb the ranks of the **UNBX leaderboard** to earn exclusive seasonal rewards. With leaderboards refreshing every quarter, the race is on to secure your place at the top and reap the benefits.

## **Climbing the Leaderboard**

There are two primary ways to ascend the leaderboard and stand out as an elite player within the UNBX community:

### **1. Seasonal IGC Wagering**
Demonstrate your commitment by the amount of In-Game Currency (IGC) you wager throughout the season. This method reflects your active participation and dedication to exploring all that UNBX has to offer.

### **2. Stellar Unboxings**
Aim for the stars with each Box you unbox. The biggest pull from a single Box could skyrocket your position on the leaderboard. While this criterion adds an element of chance, consistently unboxing high-value items increases your odds of securing a top spot.

## **Seasonal Rewards**

The victors of each season will be greeted with **$UNBX token airdrops**, enhancing their in-game and on-platform prowess. Additional perks, such as XP bonuses, further sweeten the pot, offering more ways to enjoy and succeed within the UNBX ecosystem.
