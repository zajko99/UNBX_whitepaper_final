# Reward Seasons   

The most outstanding players that earn a spot on the **UNBX leaderboard** will earn seasonal rewards. The leaderboards are active in quarterly increments, after which the rewards will be sent out and the scores reset. Scoring higher on the leaderboard, naturally, brings more rewards to the user. There are 2 main ways to earn points that count towards a playerâ€™s place on the leaderboard:


- The amount of IGC wagered in a season
- The biggest Unboxing pull out of a single Box


While the first criteria is controlled by the player, it shows dedication and commitment to the UNBX platform. On the contrary, the second criteria cannot be directly influenced by the user. However, the more Boxes with high-priced items the user Unboxes, the higher their chances of getting rewarded.

The rewards are issued as **$UNBX airdrops**, while there may be other benefits as well such as XP bonuses.
