# **Marketplace**

Welcome to the **UNBX Marketplace** — a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem tailored for the seamless exchange of NFTs and In-Game Currency (IGC).

## **🎨 Unique Ecosystem**

The UNBX Marketplace thrives on the demand to acquire IGC through NFT listings. Here, buyers — whether they're seasoned IGC earners or new users — can dive into a diverse collection of digital art, exchanging their hard-earned IGC for a piece of the future. Unlike traditional NFT marketplaces, UNBX pivots around its unique currency, offering a streamlined experience for browsing, buying, and selling across various collections and categories.

### **Connecting Your World**

With just a few clicks to connect their Web3 wallet, users can immerse themselves in the marketplace, exploring and engaging with the digital economy directly from the platform.

## **🔍 Listing Process**

### **Immediate Exchange**

Listing an NFT is straightforward. Users decide the IGC value for their NFT, list it, and may instantly receive IGC if their price is deemed “reasonable” by our acceleration process. This innovative approach ensures that NFTs match our criteria swiftly transition into the game’s ecosystem, granting sellers immediate access to IGC and minimizing delays in gameplay.

### **Unboxable Options**

Sellers have the option to make their NFTs “Unboxable,” offering them as potential rewards in single-player mode. This choice introduces a strategic element, allowing sellers to navigate price volatility while enabling buyers to directly receive the NFT or opt for its equivalent in IGC.

## **💸 Purchasing NFTs**

Purchasing on the marketplace is a seamless transaction using IGC. Once a purchase is made, the corresponding IGC amount is deducted from the buyer’s in-game balance, and the NFT is promptly transferred to their linked Web3 wallet, enriching their digital collection instantly.

## **🔄 Reinvestment Strategy**

To ensure the marketplace's vitality and sustainability, UNBX commits to reinvesting substantial portions of the revenue from cryptocurrency buy-ins back into the platform. This strategic approach aims to maintain a balanced and fair supply of NFTs, fostering an ever-evolving ecosystem for our community to thrive in.
