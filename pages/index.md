Welcome to UNBX - Ultimate NFT Boxes

## What is UNBX?

**UNBX is more than just a game.** It is a fully functioning ecosystem with our innovative marketplace and a self-sustaining economy, including leaderboard competition rewards, as well as staking rewards from our primary $UNBX token.


This whitepaper outlines our vision to merge the booming interest in NFT collectibles with the thrill of loot box gaming. UNBX aims to be the pinnacle hub of Unboxing games for both traditional gamers and Web3 enthusiasts alike.


## Core Gameplay

Our core gameplay allows you to Unbox selected Boxes containing legendary NFTs collections such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Neo Tokyo, Azuki, and more.  The rewards in the form of In-Game Currency (referred to as “IGC”) are dynamically updated to reflect the collections’ floor prices. Unbox for your own enjoyment in the **Single Player mode**, or connect with other Unboxoors and compete head-to-head in **Singles, Duos, or Three-for-All**.
