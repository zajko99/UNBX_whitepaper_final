# **Gameplay Overview**

Dive into the exciting world of UNBX, whether you're here to enjoy the game at your own pace in **Single Player Mode** or ready to take on competitors in our thrilling **Multiplayer Mode**, UNBX offers a dynamic gaming experience tailored to your preferences.

## **ðŸŽ® Single Player Mode:**

In the immersive Single Player Mode, select your preferred Box, preview its contents and probabilities, and unbox to discover your reward. Upon unboxing, the prize revealed between the on-screen indicators is yours to claim. Here's what sets our Single Player Mode apart:

- **Dynamic IGC Pricing:** If your unboxed NFT isn't marked as "Unboxable," you'll receive IGC equal to the NFT's floor price, updated in real-time from leading NFT marketplaces.
- **IGC Vouchers:** Some Boxes contain IGC vouchers, offering a fair chance at winning while diversifying our Box offerings with lower-priced options.
- **Free Trial:** Test out a Box for free without keeping the reward, perfect for exploring new Boxes risk-free.

## **ðŸ‘¥ Multiplayer Mode:**

Engage in competitive play across three exciting formats: Singles, Duos, and Three-for-All. Battle it out with fellow Unboxers in a live setting, choosing from a variety of Box combinations for each match. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

### **Singles (1v1):**
- Head-to-head battles where the winner takes all the IGC unboxed by both players.

### **Duos (2v2):**
- Team up and combine winnings with a partner. The team with the higher total wins the cumulative IGC, split between the victors.

### **Three-for-All (1v1v1):**
- A thrilling free-for-all where the top unboxer wins all the IGC pooled from the participants.

In addition to participating, players have the option to spectate battles, immersing themselves in the excitement of UNBX without spending IGC.
