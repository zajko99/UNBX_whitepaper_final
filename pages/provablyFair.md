# **Provably Fair System**

At UNBX, integrity and trust are paramount. Our commitment to fairness is embodied in our use of a **provably fair system** that guarantees the randomness and impartiality of every unboxing event. This system ensures that all participants have an equal and fair chance, preventing any possible manipulation by any party, including UNBX itself.

## **The Unboxing Process Explained**

Follow the steps below to understand how we ensure fairness in every unbox:

1. **Commitment:**
   - Users select and commit to opening a box before the unveiling of any seeds, ensuring decisions are made without bias or foreknowledge.

2. **Seed Combination:**
   After a user commits, UNBX synthesizes:
   - A **public seed**, accessible on-chain for transparency.
   - A **server seed**, securely generated by UNBX and unknown until the commitment is made.
   - A **unique nonce**, a one-time-use value ensuring every unboxing is distinct.

3. **Finalization:**
   - These elements are hashed together, creating a final, random outcome for the unboxing, rooted in cryptographic principles.

Thanks to the undisclosed server seed prior to user commitment and the additional security layers provided by the public seed and nonce, the system is safeguarded against manipulation or prediction.

## **Verification**

Transparency doesn't end with the unboxing. Users are empowered to independently verify the fairness of their experiences. The blockchain serves as an immutable ledger, offering a cryptographic audit trail that confirms UNBX's adherence to its provably fair protocols.
