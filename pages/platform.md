# Platform Overview

## The elements of the platform:

### The Unboxing Store: 
The core of our platform is the store, where users can browse and purchase Boxes containing certain NFT collections. Boxes come in different themes and price tiers based on content value and rarity.
### Gameplay: 
The Unboxing is available as a single player mode, where the user will earn IGC in the value of the Unboxed NFT. There is also a multiplayer mode, in the form of Singles, Duos, and Three-for-All. In multiplayer mode, the winning side takes all of the IGC earned by all parties.
UNBX Bank: Users can view their $UNBX & IGC balance. From the UNBX Bank, users can hard stake & soft stake the token, gaining various perks for either. After accumulating the bonus, the amounts are claimable through the UNBX Bank. Users that make the seasonal leaderboard can also claim their rewards through the UNBX Bank.
### In-Game Currency: 
The in-game currency of the platform is used to purchase Boxes and NFTs in the marketplace. Users can earn IGC through staking $UNBX or by ranking on the seasonal leaderboard.
### $UNBX Token: 
The on-chain token can be staked as explained above. Certain special items will be purchasable with the $UNBX token such as power-ups.
### Marketplace: 
The users are able to list NFTs onto the marketplace to earn IGC, as well as purchase listed NFTs with their earned IGC.

#### Goal
The goal of UNBX is to bring the thrilling experience of Unboxing to Web3 in an easy to understand and fun way. With different Box themes, rarity tiers, and game integration, UNBX aims to be the premier Unboxing destination in blockchain gaming.
